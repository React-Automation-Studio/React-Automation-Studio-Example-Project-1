#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
# Site Specific Definitions of environment variables for MDSplus
#
# How to use this Definition File: From 'usr/local/mdsplus/setup.sh'
#
# The definition file should contain the following types of lines:
#-------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
#   1) comment-line
#   2) variable-definition
#   3) include-statement
#   4) source-statement
#   5) dot-statement
#
# where:
#
#   1) comment-line:
#
#      A comment line beginning with # in first character.
#
#   2) variable-definition:
#
#      A environment variable definition of the following form:
#
#         environment-variable-name  environment-variable-value optional-delimiter-spec
#
#         where:
#
#            optional-delimiter-spec is the character ">" or "<" followed by a delimiter
#
#         Examples:
#
#            myvar foo                 (define environment variable myvar to have the value foo)
#            mytree_path $HOME/mytree  <; (define environment variable mytree_path to have the
#                                          value $HOME/mytree. If mytree_path was previously
#                                          defined, mytree_path will become $HOME/mytree followed
#                                          by a semi-colon followed by the original value.)
#            PATH $HOME/bin  :>           (Append $HOME/bin to the PATH environment variable.)
#
#   3) include-statement:
#
#        Include another definition file.
#
#        Example:
#
#            include $HOME/.mdsplus
#
#   4) source-statement
#
#        Noop in sh userd when same definition file is sourced from mdsplus.csh
#
#   5) dot-statement
#
#        Source another file with shell commands
#
#        Example:
#
#            . $HOME/myscript.csh
#
#
# Define Default tree path here
# Pass in an Environment Variable for the default tree name
# Don't terminate with `/` and use '~t' to look for the tree in a 
# folder with the same name 

#MDS_PATH          /tdi       <;
#MDS_PYDEVICE_PATH /pydevices <;

# tree_path definitions 
default_tree_path /trees/~t >;

# TODO VALIDATE: might not even need to worry about these definitions
# Example tree following the 'Trees and Data' page on MDSplus.org
my_tree_path /trees/my_tree >;

# Tree from the tutorial
tutorial_path /trees/tutorial >;

# A folder with name of experimental tree must pre-exist initialization
